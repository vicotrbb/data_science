# Data science
Repository created to store all my studies about data science &amp; machine learning

Observations:

* Some files of this repository are commented in portuguese and others in english. Usually, all the readme, project and explanatory files will be written in english;
* As I'm using this repository for learning, some content here are not completly from my authorship, sources will be always provided, if I forget, please, let me now.

## Roadmap

My learning roadmap will be based on this image, every time I complete a milestone will be added to the topic a notebook with all the stuff I have learned during the studies of that topic.
